    <h1>Hi my name is Bear</h1>

        The bear is a retired circus Kamchatka brown bear who lives in a house
        hollowed out of a tree in the forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        His past occupation makes him very talented in performing arts (like
        juggling, unicycling, and even stage magic) although he's also known to
        dabble into other hobbies and even some intellectual pursuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some episodes feature flashbacks in which he remembers his childhood as
        a cub in the same house.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Russian-language version, Masha calls him "Mishka" (Russian:
        Мишка, a diminutive form of Russian name Misha, lit. "Mikey", fig.
        "Little Bear"), the traditional name given to bears in Russian tales.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is a huge bear with a big heart and he is Masha's father-like figure,
        as well as a friendly figure to her. He was voiced by Boris Kutnevich &
        Irina Kukushkina. He earlier also resided in Moscow.
